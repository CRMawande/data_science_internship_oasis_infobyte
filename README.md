# AICTE OIB-SIP Task 1: Iris Classification
Overview
This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the AICTE OIB-SIP March-P2 Technical Assessment, focusing on the Iris Classification task. In this task, participants were required to build a classification model for iris flowers based on their features.

### Task Description
The Iris Classification task aimed to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Participants were provided with a dataset containing measurements of iris flowers' sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal was to train a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the species of iris flowers based on these measurements.

### Approach
To address this task, the following steps were undertaken:

Data Preparation: The provided dataset was preprocessed, including handling missing values, scaling features if necessary, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Logistic regression was used. Each algorithm was trained and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the model was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques were employed to optimize the model's performance.
Model Deployment: The best-performing model was selected and deployed for making predictions on new data. The deployed model can be utilized to classify iris flowers into their respective species.
Usage
To replicate the results or utilize the trained model for classification, follow these steps:

### Setup and Requirements:
To set up the environment for the Iris Flower Classification project, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE: For coding and experimentation.
Additionally, you will need access to the Iris dataset, which is commonly available in the Scikit-learn library or can be downloaded from various online sources..

# AICTE OIB-SIP Task 2: Employment Analysis

### Task Description:
The Unemployment Analysis project involves an in-depth exploration of historical labor market data and the prediction of future unemployment rates using advanced data science techniques. The primary objective is to uncover insights and formulate actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

### Approach:
This project employs Python, along with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, to conduct a thorough analysis and visualization of unemployment data. The process includes reading, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing the data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the unemployment landscape.

### Setup and Requirements:
To execute this project, Python must be installed on your system, along with the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, IPython, and access to Google Colab.

### Data Source:
The dataset for this project is contained within the file "unemployment.csv". It encompasses a range of historical labor market metrics, such as state-wise unemployment rates, employment figures, labor participation rates, and geographical coordinates.
