# AICTE OIB-SIP Task 1: Iris Classification
Overview
This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the AICTE OIB-SIP March-P2 Technical Assessment, focusing on the Iris Classification task. In this task, participants were required to build a classification model for iris flowers based on their features.

### Task Description
The Iris Classification task aimed to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Participants were provided with a dataset containing measurements of iris flowers' sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal was to train a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the species of iris flowers based on these measurements.

### Approach
To address this task, the following steps were undertaken:

Data Preparation: The provided dataset was preprocessed, including handling missing values, scaling features if necessary, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Logistic regression was used. Each algorithm was trained and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the model was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques were employed to optimize the model's performance.
Model Deployment: The best-performing model was selected and deployed for making predictions on new data. The deployed model can be utilized to classify iris flowers into their respective species.
Usage
To replicate the results or utilize the trained model for classification, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
Run the provided code scripts or notebooks to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Utilize the trained model for making predictions on new data by loading the saved model artifacts.

### Conclusion
Task 1 of the AICTE OIB-SIP March-P2 Technical Assessment involved building a classification model for iris flowers based on their features. By following a systematic approach, including data preparation, model selection, evaluation, and deployment, a reliable model was developed for accurately predicting the species of iris flowers. The solution presented in this repository serves as an example of solving classification tasks in machine learning.
